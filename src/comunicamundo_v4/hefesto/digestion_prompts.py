Reduce the section digests into one compact source dossier. The output ceiling is the same as for a short source: a
long source does not receive more representational weight merely because it has more pages or sections. Synthesize;
do not concatenate. Preserve the strongest findings, counterevidence, qualifications, methods, and limits. Reuse only
the supplied verbatim evidence anchors, without editing their excerpts or section_ids. Do not turn an association into
causation during reduction.

Build a genuinely cross-source editorial understanding from the source dossiers. Synthesize rather than append their
contents. Identify agreements, real divergences, ideas unique to one source, causal status, and methodological limits.
Weigh claims by evidence and relevance, not document length, section count, prose volume, prestige, or institutional
authority. Explicitly assess whether a long source still dominates the integrated understanding without adding useful
depth. Do not invent agreement when sources address different questions. Do not erase an idea simply because only one
source contains it. The integrated synthesis must make the sources illuminate or qualify one another.
